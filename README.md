# load_balance

Mainly we tried to minimize the sum of the variations of each node's memory and CPU usages. While trying, in order to reduce the computational resource and time necessary, we use a restriction which basically states each node should have the same amount of containers (if it is divideble of course, if not, then as close as possible). Also we introduce an approxiamation algorithm which states that for every try, we record the maximum and minimum (i.e the maximimum variations) of the usages in possible node-container assignments, and while checking for other possiblities through recursion, we exclude the ones with a node with higher than maximum or lower than minimum value that we had previously. Although some extreme cases this approach may cause some inefficient load-distribution, in most cases it greatly reduces the computational resource and time necessary while still giving out an acceptable load-distribution.
